Our goal with this project was to analyze how public news coverage affects the stock market. We used these data sets to analyze market data to find dates of significant price movement. We utilized the NYT Archive API to pull articles from specified date ranges.

As each member focused on different aspects of this project, there are three Jupyter notebooks containing relevant code. Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb located in Branch Brian-feature contains code exploring the S&P 500 and code for application to retrieve NYT data for user's choice of date. Sentiment_Analysis_Bonjanette.ipynb in Branch Bonjanette-feature contains code exploring market sectors and related headline data pulled from the NYSE API. Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb in Branch Matt-branch contains code exploring individual stock movements.
